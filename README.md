# Rubik's Cube Visualizer

This project is a **Rubik's Cube Visualizer** built with Python, leveraging **PyQtGraph** for dynamic and interactive 3D graphics. The visualizer simulates the movement of a Rubik's Cube, allowing you to experience how different algorithms manipulate the cube visually.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of Rubik's Cube moves and rotations.
- Utilizes **PyQtGraph** for a smooth and interactive 3D experience.
- Numpy for data manupulation.

## PyQtGraph Showcase

This project uses **PyQtGraph** to create a 3D representation of the Rubik's Cube, which provides:

- **Efficient Rendering**: Smooth cube manipulations without lag.
- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom, rotate, and explore the cube from different angles.
